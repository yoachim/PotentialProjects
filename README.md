# Potential Projects

Here are a number of potential research projects I'm interested in working on.

## Combine IFU data cubes with archival aperture photometry

https://github.com/yoachim/IFU_Aperture_Phot

Given the wealth of archival imaging out there, we need stellar population fitting software that can incorporate both spectra and photometry.


## PSF effects on measuring thick disk flux

This paper http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A.106S basically makes the claim that my thesis work is junk because I didn't take into account how light diffracts as it is imaged by the telescope.  

## Are GLSB cores normal elliptical galaxies?

XXX-touch base with Denise to see what's going on here.
follow-up based on this paper: https://github.com/yoachim/glsbPaper

## Telescope Scheduling

I'd like to modify astroplan to estimate signal-to-noise since that is the thing observers tend to want to optimize. 


## Stellar metallicities with LSST + narrow band filters

Take a bunch of stellar spectra, figure out how well LSST will be able to recover stellar metallicty. What if we add a narrow-band filter? https://github.com/lsst-sims/sims_narrowband_stellarZ

## Astronomer Employment via publication records

damn, I need to finish this:
