# Potential Projects

Here are a number of potential research projects I'm interested in working on.

## Combine IFU data cubes with archival aperture photometry

https://github.com/yoachim/IFU_Aperture_Phot

Given the wealth of archival imaging out there, we need stellar population fitting software that can incorporate both spectra and photometry. There are a huge number of codes that fit specta, and a bunch that fit SEDs (see http://www.sedfitting.org/SED08/Fitting.html), but I still haven't found anything that does both.


## PSF effects on measuring thick disk flux

This paper http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...577A.106S basically makes the claim that my thesis work is junk because I didn't take into account how light diffracts as it is imaged by the telescope.  

## Are GLSB cores normal elliptical galaxies?

XXX-touch base with Denise to see what's going on here.
follow-up based on this paper: https://github.com/yoachim/glsbPaper

## Telescope Scheduling

I'd like to modify astroplan to estimate signal-to-noise since that is the thing observers tend to want to optimize. 


## Stellar metallicities with LSST + narrow band filters

Take a bunch of stellar spectra, figure out how well LSST will be able to recover stellar metallicty. What if we add a narrow-band filter? https://github.com/lsst-sims/sims_narrowband_stellarZ

## Astronomer Employment via publication records

damn, I need to finish this:

## Gemini South Archive of Stellar Spectra

Use the Gemini South data archive to look at how the sky background and atmospheric parameters vary with time. Talk from SPIE made it sound like they were already doing similar things. (talk was by Katherine Roth (Gemini) of work by Aam Smith (Gemini)).

## Structure in Outer Galaxy Disks

In this paper (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...752...97Y), we looked at the star formation histories in the outskirts of 12 galaxies.  Given new simulations, we'd like to see if there are spiral arms or other excited modes in the faint outer parts of these galaxies.  If we can't find archival data, this would be a fun observing project to use APO for. 

## Making better plots

I would like to make a utility function that makes it easy to generate publication-ready and slide-ready and web-ready images all at the same time:  https://github.com/yoachim/matplotlib_pubplots

## Stellar metallicties with LSST and narrow band imaging

If we were to add a narrow band filter to LSST, where should we put it to optimize how well we can recover stellar matallicities?  

## Spec out a better all-sky camera for LSST

I want a nice little notebook that specs out how deep one would have to observe the sky to measure cloud extiction to a given extinction depth and spatial resolution and extinction precision.
